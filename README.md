# Azure App Server Demo
## By Jess Hoch
## The Terraform configuration files will deploy the resources for a app server cluster in Azure.
## If you are using ACG's Azure Sandbox, you will need to import the Resource Group into your configuration using the `terraform import` command so it is in your state file in both working directories.
## You will first deploy the resource for your remote state in the `remote_state_storage directory`
## After you have done that, you will move into the `app_servers` directory and deploy the resources for you app servers.
## Remember you must use the information from the outputs of your remote state storage in you app_server backend configuration file.
## Good luck!
